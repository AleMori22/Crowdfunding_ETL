# Crowdfunding_ETL

In this directory you'll find:

1. **ETL_Mini_Project_Code.ipynb** : This Jupyter Notebook file loads the **crowdfunding.xlsx** and **contacts.xlsx** files from the **Resources** folder, transforms them, and then saves the resulting tables as: **campaign.csv**, **category.csv**, **contacts.csv** and  **subcategory.csv** in the same.

2. The **crowdfunding_db_schema.sql** This file contains the SQL script to generate the tables corresponding to the data outputted by the **ETL_Mini_Project_Code.ipynb** in a PostgreSQL database.            

3. **Resources** This directory contains all the resource files and the cleaned data output.

All the code in this repository has been developed by me with the help of class materials.
